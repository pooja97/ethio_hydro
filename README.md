#### Added functionalities to display daily average temperature, monthly mean temperature, Annual Max, Min and Avg temperature, Daily precipitation, min,max and avg precipitation, Cumulative and monthly avg precipitation. 
#### Created ethiopia's map and implemented a bi-directional communication using haversine distance to fetch the nearest location and display the fetched locations data using streamlit-folium, branca, and Numpy.
#### implemented caching technique to speed up the application loading process. 
#### Containerized the application using Docker.
